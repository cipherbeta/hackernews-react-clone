# HackerNews Clone
Built using React. Still a couple things in progress - user pages, job pages, etc - but otherwise general functionality for reading posts / comments is solid.

## How to Use
Clone the repository. Run `npm i` in this directory to install any necessary dependencies, then `npm start` to spool up the dev server. If you want to build the static site files, run `npm run build`. As the project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), check that out for further information.

Original repo was hosted on GitLab during the great 6 hour outage of GitHub. It can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/WaifuCannon/hackernews-clone).
